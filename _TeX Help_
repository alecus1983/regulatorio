--- HELP ---
LaTeX produced printed output before encountering a \begin{document}
command. Either you forgot the \begin{document} command or there is
something wrong in the preamble. The problem may be a stray character
or an error in a declaration---for example, omitting the braces around
an argument or forgetting the \ in a command name.
